# Particle Classification in the PANDA Experiment using Machine Learning

The PANDA experiment will study the annihilation of protons with anti-protons to learn how the fundamental building blocks of nature, quarks and gluons, form building blocks of matter such as the proton or neutron. The experiment will use a very high intensity anti-proton beam hitting a fixed proton target. In the resulting $\bar{p}p$ annihilations, radiation is emitted, consisting of various different kind of particles. The setup is composed of different components, all capable of detecting different kinds of particles. 

In this project, we focus on the electromagnetic-calorimeter (EMC). The EMC is designed to measure the scattering angle and energy of high-energetic photons originating from the $\bar{p}p$ interaction point.
